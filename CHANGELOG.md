# Changelog

## v0.1.1 — 2026-08-28

Documentation, evidence and CI. **No change to the node's behaviour**: the code that
runs is what `v0.1.0` shipped, plus a version-string fix.

### Honest status, up front

`v0.1.0`'s README read as though the node were reachable — "it has a public mailbox",
"the Technocore lane is live", "send a signed job to its mailbox". It is not reachable,
and was not on the day that text was written. The mailbox and the owned result room
cannot be created while the upstream instance is at its room and note caps, and there is
no public HTTPS endpoint because no DNS record exists yet.

None of that is a defect in this code and all of it was reported at the time — but a
release page is read by people who did not read the report, and "live" was the wrong word
for something nobody can reach. The README now opens with a status table separating what
is **built** from what is **currently available**, every conditional path says so, and the
`v0.1.0` release notes carry the same limitations.

### Added

- `docs/reviews/CODEX_REVIEW_V0.1.0.md` — the nine-round pre-release review: each round's
  P0 and P1 findings, the fix and the test for each, and what the reviewer was pushed back
  on. It states plainly that this was a local Codex CLI review and **not** a GitHub Pull
  Request Review, and carries the SHA-256 of the transcript archive.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — lint, format, strict types, unit and integration tests,
  `pip-audit`, secret scan, package build and metadata check, and a working-tree-clean
  gate; plus a separate end-to-end job that stands up the upstream server pinned to the
  commit in `proof/protocol-snapshot.json` and runs the live suite against it on loopback.
  Actions are pinned to commit SHAs. The workflow never writes to the public Technocore
  instance and uploads no artifact.
- `.python-version`, so a local run and CI agree on the interpreter.

### Changed

- The client's `User-Agent` is derived from `__version__` instead of a literal. It had
  kept announcing `0.1.0`, which is exactly how a hardcoded version behaves.
- `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/CONTRIBUTION_PROTOCOL.md` distinguish
  implemented behaviour from currently reachable behaviour.

### Unchanged and still true

- Third-party usage: **0 jobs, 0 requesters.**
- The FLOP testnet adapter is a disabled stub: no endpoint, no chain id, no address.
- No airdrop, points, endorsement, certification or official status is claimed, and this
  is not affiliated with FLOP Labs or Technocore.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-08-28

First release. A `did:key` agent that performs deterministic verification work for other
agents and publishes a signed, independently checkable receipt for every job: four tasks,
an evidence ledger, a read-only HTTP surface, and a receipt chain verifiable offline.

See `docs/reviews/CODEX_REVIEW_V0.1.0.md` for the pre-release review that preceded it.
